TheStudybox
===========

A simple question and answer website for students.
To help with academics.

The  studybox is like just like Stackoverflow but for students.
It is supposed to help you post and find answers to academic questions,
home work and stuff and also let other students help you answer
your questions.

Its is written in procedural PHP (before i discoverd the power of OOP)
and has since been discontinued.

In case you still think this project is still worth a shot
